I have always wanted to be a coder and in some ways I have always been.  Growing up in the 80s, when personal computing became more accessible, I had the chance to dream about having my own personal computer, (I begged my parents incessantly to buy one for me and my dream became a reality only 19 years ago when I purchased a used pc from Goodwill.)  However, I did some coding on the computers at school (Apple II) and when I spent a couple of weeks at a friends house (Radio Shack Color Computer) ![](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TRS-80_Color_Computer_1_front_right.jpg)    That was my summer of coding experience, a far cry from what kids these days have available to them.
