I have always wanted to be a coder and in some ways I've always been one.  Growing up in the 80s, when personal computing became more accessible, I had the chance to *dream* about having my own personal computer, (I begged my parents incessantly to buy one for me and my dream became a reality only 19 years ago when I purchased a used pc from Goodwill.)  However, I did some coding on the computers at school (Apple II) and when I spent a couple of weeks at a friends house (Radio Shack Color Computer)  That was my "summer of coding" experience.  Not much compared to the resources and connectivity that 21st-century kids have available to them.  (We didn't even know what internet was.) 

Despite all these impediments I have always been a coder at heart. ( I was even able to put my skills to work by reprogramming the cash register of the restaurant where I worked.)  Slowly throughout the past years I have been able to learn some skills like Linux command line, HTML, CSS, C# (Yes, I did have a brush with ASP.NET development, which shares quite a lot concepts with Ruby and Rails development.)

Now, even at this mid-point in my life, I jumped at the chance to be able to hone and refine what I already know and acquire new skills  by enrolling in Flatiron School.  I want the challenge and the opportunity to collaborate with others and create good things. 

You either use it or you'll lose it.  Like everything, if you practice enough, eventually it becomes (almost) second nature.  Even though at first I've struggled to understand certain concepts, I do get it after a fashion resulting in a feeling of accomplishment, as if I had conquered a mountain peak, a natural high!
